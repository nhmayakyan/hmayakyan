                establishments we own, and our mission in the city of Yerevan.</p>
            <p>Collective Group was founded by a team of individuals passionate about good music, comfort, quality, and
                exceptional design. We noticed that all four were rarely ever combined when it came to establishments
                such as cafes, restaurants, and bars, so we decided to redefine customer experience close to home. Thus,
                we ended up opening six different establishments across our hometown Yerevan, all under the “Collective
                Group” name, and we’re still growing!</p>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Collective’s mission is to provide an exceptional customer experience while giving people the chance to
                relax from their everyday hassles and problems. We pride ourselves on choosing top-quality ingredients,
                training our staff to provide unmatched customer service, and closely working with design specialists to
                make our establishments easy on the eye. </p>
            <p>Another key aspect of our mission is growth, considering that everything started from a single juice bar
                concept back in 2008. Although we already have six renowned establishments across Yerevan, this is only
                the beginning. We have plans to expand further, open new spots, and satisfy customer demands.</p>
            <p>Make sure to regularly check our News page for important updates concerning the future of Collective
                Group, and stay up to date with new projects. Big things are coming soon!</p>

                <p class="p1">The Birth of Our Team</p>
                <p class="p2">The idea for Collective as you know it began with our founder Artak Harutyunyan and his
                    concept for Fresh House. Artak wanted to establish a juice bar prioritizing quality and using only
                    the freshest ingredients in shakes and smoothies. From every orange to every carton of milk, he
                    would inspect the ingredients for product quality and pay close attention to best-by dates -
                    something lacking in Yerevan despite the large numbers of cafes, restaurants, and bars being opened
                    every month.</p>
                <p class="p2">Artak then started to build a team to expand the Fresh House range and open new spots
                    across town, resulting in the founding of Collective Group.</p>

            <div class="sec5-1-3">
                <p class="p1">The Present Day</p>
                <p class="p2">Every single person on our team - from senior managers to waiters and waitresses - puts
                    quality and good service at the forefront of their daily tasks. From the products we use; to the
                    people we hire; to the interior design we decide on - everything is about putting customer
                    experience first. As of now, the Collective team continues to grow, with more exciting projects on
                    the way.</p>
